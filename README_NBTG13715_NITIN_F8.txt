Respected sir I have done this project individually .
I have Created different functions for different games.
I provided a Menu for user to select choice  and start playing selected game.
After end of game all  data will be stored in text file and then again Menu for choice is shown .
This Process is continued till user pressed 7 to exit from game.
Finally  after exit , owner will get net profit written on screen and all all details of all players will be printed from text file.

Nitin Shukla sir and Raju paul sir helps me to understand C concepts especially random function to use in my project.
I want to thank all sdf teacher as Whenever I feel difficulty in any concept, I  ask freely from any SDF  teacher , every teacher was always supportive to me to help.
